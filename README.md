## Features:
- Add a Task: Adds a task with the title and defaults the status to "todo."
- Update a Task: Allows updating the title of a task by its ID.
- Delete a Task: Deletes a task by its ID.
- Mark a Task: Marks a task as "In Progress" or "Done."
- List Tasks: Lists all tasks or filters tasks by their status (e.g., "Done," "todo," or "In Progress").
- Error Handling: Provides feedback if a task ID is not found.
